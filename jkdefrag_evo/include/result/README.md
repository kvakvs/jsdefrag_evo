**Result** is a modern, simple, and light-weight error-handling alternative to
exceptions with a rich feature-set.

## Features

‚úîÔ∏è Offers a coherent, light-weight alternative to exceptions \
‚úîÔ∏è Compatible with <kbd>C++11</kbd> (with more features in <kbd>C++14</kbd> and <kbd>C++17</kbd>) \
‚úîÔ∏è Single-header, **header-only** solution -- easily drops into any project \
‚úîÔ∏è Zero overhead abstractions -- don't pay for what you don't use. \
‚úîÔ∏è No dependencies \
‚úîÔ∏è Support for value-type, reference-type, and `void`-type values in `result` \
‚úîÔ∏è Monadic composition functions like `map`, `flat_map`, and `map_error` for
easy functional use \
‚úîÔ∏è Optional support to disable all exceptions and rename the `cpp` `namespace` \
‚úîÔ∏è [Comprehensively unit tested](https://coveralls.io/github/bitwizeshift/result?branch=master) for both static
behavior and runtime validation \
‚úîÔ∏è [Incurs minimal cost when optimized](https://godbolt.org/z/TsonT1), especially for trivial types

Check out the [tutorial](doc/tutorial.md) to see what other features **Result**
offers.

If you're interested in how `cpp::result` deviates from `std::expected`
proposals, please see [this page](doc/deviations-from-proposal.md).

## Teaser

```cpp
enum class narrow_error{ none, loss_of_data };

template <typename To, typename From>
auto try_narrow(const From& from) noexcept -> cpp::result<To,narrow_error>
{
  const auto to = static_cast<To>(from);

  if (static_cast<From>(to) != from) {
    return cpp::fail(narrow_error::loss_of_data);
  }

  return to;
}

struct {
  template <typename T>
  auto operator()(const T& x) -> std::string {
    return std::to_string(x);
  }
} to_string;

auto main() -> int {
  assert(try_narrow<std::uint8_t>(42LL).map(to_string) == "42");
}
```

## Why `result`?

Error cases in C++ are often difficult to discern from the API. Any function
not marked `noexcept` can be assumed to throw an exception, but the exact _type_
of exception, and if it even derives from `std::exception`, is ambiguous.
Nothing in the language forces which exceptions may propagate from an API, which
can make dealing with such APIs complicated.

Often it is more desirable to achieve `noexcept` functions where possible, since
this allows for better optimizations in containers (e.g. optimal moves/swaps)
and less cognitive load on consumers.

Having a `result<T, E>` type on your API not only semantically encodes that
a function is _able lcn_to_ fail, it also indicates to the caller _how_ the function
may fail, and what discrete, testable conditions may cause it to fail -- which
is what this library intends to solve.

As a simple example, compare these two identical functions:

```cpp
// (1)
auto to_uint32(const std::string& x) -> std::uint32_t;

// (2)
enum class parse_error { overflow=1, underflow=2, bad_input=3 };
auto to_uint32(const std::string& x) noexcept -> result<std::uint32_t, parse_error>;
```

In `(1)`, it is ambiguous _what_ (if anything) this function may throw on
failure, or how this error case may be accounted for.

In `(2)`, on the other hand, it is explicit that `to_uint32` _cannot_ throw --
so there is no need for a `catch` handler. It's also clear that it may fail for
whatever reasons are in `parse_error`, which discretely enumerates any possible
case for failure.

## Compiler Compatibility

**Result** is compatible with any compiler capable of compiling valid
<kbd>C++11</kbd>. Specifically, this has been tested and is known to work
with:

* GCC 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
* Clang 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11
* Apple Clang (Xcode) 10.3, 11.2, 11.3, 12.3
* Visual Studio 2017<sup>[1]</sup>, 2019

Latest patch level releases are assumed in the versions listed above.

**Note:** Visual Studios 2015 is not currently supported due to an internal
compiler error experienced in the default constructor of `result`. Support for
this will be added at a later time.

<sup>[1] Visual Studios 2017 is officially supported, though toolchain 14.16
has some issues properly compiling `map_error` due to insufficient support for
SFINAE.</sup>
